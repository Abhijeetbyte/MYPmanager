The "My Password Manager" (MYPmanager) allows users to securely store and manage their passwords and other sensitive information, using encryption to protect the data locally (more securely). The application includes features such as the ability to add, edit, and delete credentials and search for credentials based on specific criteria.

The code is well-organized and easy to read, with clear comments and explanations of each section of the code. The application has a user interface, which includes a main window with tabs for managing credentials and various buttons for performing actions such as adding or deleting credentials.
This is useful for managing personal passwords and other sensitive information. The code is well-written and easy to modify to fit specific needs or to add additional functionality.
